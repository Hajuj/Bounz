## Playing The Game

Move the Ball with the Arrow Keys: Left to go left, Right to go Right, Up to Jump

Collect all the Rings and make it to the end to finish a Level

The spiky chalices make you small, the dull chalices make you big. 
  - When you are big, you jump higher and float on water
  - When you are small, you can fit through tiny gaps

The spiky enemy kills you (duh!). You have 3 lives. Be sure to not lose them all.
  
### Additional Tips
- Collect the little blue balls for extra lives
- start with the MainMenu :-)
- Due to how the assignment is submitted, the game might use Unitys default camera. This does not work on our project therefore you might want to use the Executable since it includes our camera.
- Have fun
